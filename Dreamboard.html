    <h3>Life can change signifigantly over the course of a year. Imagine what can happen in 3 years. 3yrs ago I had just move from Maryland to Texas. I was sad, my previous life plan had just fallen apart and I had to find a new one. I was scared, because I was all alone. And I was self consious, because I wasn't sure if I would be able to make it through school. 3 years later, I'm here, graduated Cum Laude, and being given the chance to change my life.</h3>

    <h2> Move to Raleigh, NC</h2>

        <p>I've gathered and vizualized the data. And found that I can live in Raleigh,NC if I work in the health care industry. Raleigh is only a 5 hour drive from my family so I'll still be able to visit them for holidays. After my grandmother died last year and I stuggled to get home to my family I decided that I don't want to live too far from them again.</p>

    <h2>Design my Dream Apartment</h2>

        <p>My home space means alot to me. It's where I feel most comofortable and safe. Moving around so much in past meant I could never build a place that really felt like home let alone or reflect who I was. But I am ready for that to change. My favorite style mixes rustic boho and industrial. I feel like its a perfect marriage of feminie and tomboy.</p>
